# 📊 Tackling Household Food Waste Using Data Science

This project is part of a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) assessment focused on **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**. It presents a one-page infographic titled **"Tackling Household Food Waste Using Data Science"**, which explores how data-driven approaches can reduce food waste at the household level in Malaysia.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how data science techniques and digital tools (such as mobile apps and analytics) can address the problem of household food waste, especially in the context of Malaysia’s high contribution to regional waste.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Malaysia is one of the largest contributors to food waste in Asia. A significant portion of this waste originates from households. This leads to unnecessary loss of resources (food, time, money), environmental strain, and inefficient consumption patterns.

## 📱 Data Product: ExpiryEye (Mobile App)

A mock-up prototype of a mobile app named **ExpiryEye** was developed. It helps households:

- Track food inventory and expiry dates  
- Receive timely notifications to consume before expiry  
- Log waste and get insights into their waste behavior  
- Receive tips and recipe suggestions to reduce spoilage
